We have an existing React Native app (ios/android) that we would like changes done on

1. shaping & stretching features (see planit 2d app as an example)
2. Drag rooms and Items directly from Menu (like planit2d app)
3. Adjust 'grid' opacity on the floorplan screen (light / darker/ see through etc)
4. Change Measurement Type -> Metric / Imperial system
(toggle in settings of app to change the measurement type)
5. Internal / External guides (see examples of real life floorplans they have this on them)
6. Implement usage apis (Api end points will be provided)

Likely more work provided for right candidate, please look at the planit 2d as an example of what modifications we're trying to make.

If requested I will provide existing apk of our app so that you can get a feel for it.
